For the request query, the space in protein name should be replaced with "%20".
The link at "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1634271/url-encoding-the-space-character-or-20"
says that you should encode space with %20 before the "?" and with "+" after the "?".
Here, it has been encoded with %20

The actula query looks like this:
