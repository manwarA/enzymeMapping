# enzymeMapping
The enzyme names from BRENDA dataset to match against the UniProt IDs
The file "brenda_results_allHumanEnzymes.csv" has been downloaded from BRENDA database.
The mapping is not accurate, as a single name of any protein matches multiple entries in the UniPort, thus, it fetches more than one entry from the UniProt. 
The next hurdle is how to identify the correct BRENDA protein names to UniProt IDs/entries.
